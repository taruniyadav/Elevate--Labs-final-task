1. Increase SMS Reminder Effectiveness
Insight: Patients who received SMS reminders had fewer no-shows (as shown in Power BI).

Recommendation:

Send timely reminders (e.g., 24 hours and 2 hours before appointments).

Personalize reminders using the patient's name, date, and time.

Track open/click rates if possible to improve engagement.


 2. Age-Based Scheduling Adjustments
Insight: No-show rates vary significantly by age group (e.g., younger or older patients may miss more).

Recommendation:

Offer flexible time slots for high-risk age groups.

Consider follow-up calls for elderly patients instead of just SMS.

Use transportation support services where needed.

3. Optimize Appointment Day and Time
Insight: Higher no-shows on specific days (e.g., Mondays or Fridays).

Recommendation:

Avoid scheduling first-time appointments on high no-show days.

Shift critical or long appointments to mid-week (Tuesdayâ€“Thursday).

 4. Neighbourhood-Based Outreach
Insight: Some neighborhoods show consistently higher no-show rates.

Recommendation:

Deploy targeted awareness campaigns or community health workers in these areas.

Investigate local issues (e.g., transport, awareness) that may contribute to missed appointments


 5. Leverage Scholarship & Financial Aid Insights
Insight: Patients with scholarships may show different no-show patterns.

Recommendation:

Use this data to offer proactive support (reminders, education) for low-income patients.

Review whether appointment costs or co-pays are a barrier.


 6. Integrate Predictive Model into Scheduling System
Insight: Your decision tree model can identify high-risk patients.

Recommendation:

Use the model's predictions to flag risky appointments.

Take action: schedule follow-ups, double confirm with the patient, or adjust scheduling buffer.


7. Feedback Loop and Model Improvement
Insight: Predictive accuracy improves with feedback.

Recommendation:

After each no-show, collect reasons and feed them back into the model.

Regularly retrain your model on updated data (monthly or quarterly).


8. Dashboard Monitoring and Alerts
Insight: Real-time no-show trends are visible in Power BI.

Recommendation:

Set up alerts in Power BI for spikes in no-show rates.

Share dashboards with clinic managers to adjust operations daily.
