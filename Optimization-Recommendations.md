#  Optimization Recommendations for Healthcare Appointment No-Shows

Based on analysis using a decision tree model and Power BI dashboards, the following strategies are proposed to reduce patient no-shows and improve appointment scheduling efficiency.

##  1. Increase SMS Reminder Effectiveness
- Send reminders 24 and 2 hours before appointments.
- Personalize messages with patient name, date, and time.
- Monitor engagement to improve reminder timing and format.

## 2. Age-Based Scheduling Adjustments
- Offer flexible time slots for age groups with higher no-show rates.
- Provide follow-up calls or transportation assistance for elderly patients.

##  3. Optimize Appointment Day and Time
- Avoid first-time appointments on high no-show days (e.g., Mondays).
- Prioritize mid-week scheduling for longer or important visits.

## üèò 4. Neighbourhood-Based Outreach
- Focus communication efforts in neighborhoods with high no-show patterns.
- Address local barriers such as transportation or clinic access.

##  5. Financial Aid and Scholarship Insights
- Provide additional support or follow-up to low-income patients.
- Ensure financial aid recipients are aware and reminded of their appointments.

##  6. Integrate Predictive Model into Scheduling
- Use the trained model to flag high-risk appointments.
- Proactively reach out to patients predicted to miss their appointment.

##  7. Feedback Loop and Model Improvement
- Collect no-show reasons post-appointment.
- Regularly retrain and refine the model using updated data.

##  8. Dashboard Alerts and Monitoring
- Set up Power BI alerts for rising no-show trends.
- Use real-time dashboards to enable daily operational adjustments.
